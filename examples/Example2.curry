-- | The 'MyMaybe' type encapsulates an optional value.
data MyMaybe a = MyNothing | MyJust a

-- | Simple type synonym example.
type MyTypeSynonym1 = MyMaybe Int

-- | Another example with a type parameter.
type MyTypeSynonym2 a = MyMaybe [a]

--- An old-style constructor.
--- @cons MyOldCons1 The first constructor
--- @cons MyOldCons2 The second constructor
data OldStyleCons = MyOldCons1

-- | A new-style constructor.
data NewStyleCons = MyNewCons1 -- ^ The first constructor
                  | MyNewCons2 -- ^ The second constructor

--- We can also mix the styles.
--- @cons MyMixedCons1 The first constructor
data MixedStyleCons = MyMixedCons1 -- ^ ... is this one.
                    | MyMixedCons2 -- ^ The second constructor

-- | A simple function.
myOperation1 :: MyMaybe Int -> MyMaybe Int
myOperation1 MyNothing  = MyNothing
myOperation1 (MyJust a) = MyJust (a + 1)

-- | Another simple function.
myOperation2 :: a -> [b]
myOperation2 _ = []

-- | A nondeterministic operation.
myOperation3 :: a -> a -> a
myOperation3 = (?)

--- A function with an old-style comment.
--- @param x The input value
--- @return Some result
