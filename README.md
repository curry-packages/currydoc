currydoc: A Documentation Generator for Curry Programs
======================================================

This package contains a tool to generate
the documentation for a Curry program (i.e., the main module
and all its imported modules) in HTML (or LaTeX) format.
The generated HTML pages contain information about
all data types and functions exported by a module as well
as links between the different entities.
Furthermore, some information about the definitional status
of functions (like rigid, flexible, external, complete, or
overlapping definitions) are provided and combined with
documentation comments provided by the programmer.

The usage of this tool is described in the manual
which is part of the manual of the Curry systems
[PAKCS](https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/) and
[KiCS2](https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2/).
